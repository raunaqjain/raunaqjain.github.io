Hello! I'm Raunaq, a computer science graduate student based in Buffalo, New York. I enjoy solving challenges and building applications for a purpose. My goal is to provide users with exceptional features that support them in their daily life.

Before joining [University at Buffalo](http://www.buffalo.edu/), I interned at [Hypothizer](https://www.linkedin.com/company/docmentai-hypothizer/about/), where I built a cloud-native document processing platform to capture intelligence-ready data.

Recently, I worked with [Prof. Steve Ko](https://nsr.cse.buffalo.edu/?page_id=272), where I designed a secure file storage system in Rust and proved its memory safety through software verification. Currently, I am working with [Prof. Varun Chandola](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~chandola/) & [Prof. Marc BÃ¶hlen](https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/art/faculty/directory/bohlen-marc.html) to develop an application that classifies images and videos of plant species.
