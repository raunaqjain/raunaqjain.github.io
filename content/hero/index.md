I'm a Software Development Engineer at Audible, with a mission to make our customers have the best experience listening Audiobooks. I graduated from the University at Buffalo with a Masters in Computer Science and an immense desire to create something life-changing.

I have been involved in the domain of Machine Learning since my undergrad, and even have a publication against my name!

Outside of work, I am either playing Xbox, or watching movies, anime or F1.
