I'm a computer science graduate student at University at Buffalo, New York. My primary interests extend towards the intersection of Distributed Systems and Machine Learning. I am interested in conducting novel research that improves the state-of-the-art and leaves an impact on society for the greater good. Outside of academia, I play guitar, chess, binge movies and listen to rock music.
